    "So far, we have looked mainly at R-squared values along with some visualization techniques to confirm if the data and residuals fit the the given set of assumptions. In this lesson, we will look at some statistical procedures to further understand our model and results it produces. We will be looking at the results we obtained in the regression analysis outcomes for Advertising dataset in the previous lab. \n",

    "* Use the Jarque-Bera test for normal distribution of residuals\n",

    "> Regression diagnostic is a set of procedures available for regression analysis that seek to assess the validity of a model in any of a number of different ways. This assessment may be an exploration of the model's underlying statistical assumptions, an examination of the structure of the model by considering formulations that have fewer, more or different explanatory variables, or a study of subgroups of observations, looking for those that are either poorly represented by the model (outliers) or that have a relatively large effect on the regression model's predictions.[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_diagnostic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will revisit some of the methods we have already seen, along with some new tests and how to interpret them . \n",
    "\n",
    "## Normality Check (Q-Q plots) \n",
    "We have already seen Q-Q plots as a measure to check for the normality (or any other distribution). These are also referred to as normal density plots when used with a standard normal quantiles. These plots are a good way to inspect the distribution of model errors. We saw this earlier with a toy dataset, let's plot a Q-Q for the residuals in `sales~TV` model. "

A result of 1 and above would means that the normality null hypothesis has been rejected at the 5% significance level. In other words, the data does not come from a normal distribution. A value of 0 indicates the data is normally distributed. We have already seen JB test using `model.summary()`. Following code shows how to run this test on its own. "
